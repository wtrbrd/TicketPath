## WHAT IS THING SUPPOSED TO DO?

This app provides an overview of the ticket information, including ID, technician who created the ticket, the date and time, tags, and a field for the manual IS lookup. With the tech and time information, I would be able to go in and manually check the IS chat logs for an IS chat and be able to connect the information from the IS chat to the customer chat by adding in the ticket ID in a field on the app. 



## OK BUT WHATS THE GOAL?
Increase first contact resolution by understanding the technician workflow in relation to the newly formed Internal Support team, and to decrease the overall impact of tickets made from chat.
